"""This repo's dry-run hooks — the only part of the dry-run that is yours.

gentar/dryrun.py is the kit's file and stays byte-identical to the pinned
engine's copy (`gentar/run.sh --check` compares), so everything a subject
needs to adapt lives here. Any name left out keeps dryrun.py's default.
REPO below is the checkout, for a prepare() that builds from it.

    Runs PER SUITE, not once per sweep: every suite gets its own scratch
    home and workspace, as every scenario gets its own bench. And only for
    the suites it stands in for: with SKIP_STEP_SUBSTR set, prepare() runs
    for a suite that has a step matching it, and for no other — so a build
    cannot shadow what an unrelated suite installs. With SKIP_STEP_SUBSTR
    empty it runs for every suite. Fixtures EVERY suite needs therefore
    belong in the suites' own steps, or leave SKIP_STEP_SUBSTR empty. If
    your scenarios assume a built binary or generated fixtures, do it
    here (REPO is the checkout; env["HOME"] is this suite's scratch home;
    env["WORKSPACE_DIR"] its staged checkout). Put the subject's own
    binaries in env["HOME"] + "/.local/bin": whatever lands there is
    hidden from the real PATH for the suite (see sealed_path). Expensive
    builds should cache outside HOME and copy in — `go build` and most
    compilers already cache on their own.
